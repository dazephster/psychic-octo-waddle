This project is a little personal website I made to learn more about web development,
and to have as a showcase for future projects and other fun things I'd like to share!

The site works on desktop and mobile devices except for the Hobbies page.
I was experimenting with more complex animations and didn't plan out how that page
would look on mobile screens. I'll make a fix for that page in the future.
